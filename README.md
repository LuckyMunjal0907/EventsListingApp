# EventsListingApp
# Clone the solution and you should be able to run it
# I have added an events-localData.json file as a fallback file in case the event source url does not work
# I have created this application in .net 8.0 with blazor components.
# First time I have used Blazor, it was a good opporunity to develop something and learn that as well :-)
# This has been deloyed to aws EBS as an app, url for the same is http://eventslistingapp-dev.eba-7gmst2hq.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com. I used aws toolkit for it
# created a new API for these changes the url for that is: http://eventlistingapi-dev.eba-pfvyjmjb.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/eventsource
# changed the web app code to call the API and get the events data to add more layers, url is: http://eventslistingappwithapi-dev.eba-7kz9s2kb.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
