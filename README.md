# EventsListingApp
#Clone the solution and you should be able to run it
#I have added an events-localData.json file as a fallback file in case the event source url does not work
# I have created this application in .net 8.0 with blazor components.
# First time I have used Blazor, it was a good opporunity to develop something and learn that as well :-)
# This has been deloyed to aws EBS as an app, url for the same is http://eventslistingapp-dev.eba-7gmst2hq.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com.
